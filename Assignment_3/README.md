## 📖 Problem Description
Welcome to the "Hello World" of Machine Learning! 🌍

In this assignment, we work with the famous **Iris dataset**. The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species based on their measurements:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

We use the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to learn from the data and predict the species of new flowers.

## 🚀 Key Concepts

### 1. Classification 🏷️
Unlike regression (predicting a number), **Classification** is about predicting a category or label.
- **Input**: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width.
- **Output**: Species Name (e.g., "Setosa").

### 2. The Iris Dataset 🌺
This dataset contains 150 samples (50 per species). It's perfect for beginners because the classes are well-separated, especially Setosa.

### 3. Pair Plots 📊
We use `seaborn.pairplot` to visualize relationships between every pair of features. It helps us see which features are best for separating the classes.
- **Hint**: Look at Petal Length vs Petal Width!

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Open `Iris_Classification.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells to load the data and see the beautiful pair plot.
3. Train the KNN model and see how accurate it is (spoiler: it's usually very high! 🎯).
4. Check the prediction for the mystery flower at the end!
